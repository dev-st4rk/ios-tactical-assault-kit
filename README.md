# ios-tactical-assault-kit
 The iOS Tactical Assault Kit is a geospatial infrastructure and military awareness app for iPhone. It allows for precision targeting, the intelligence of the formation of the surrounding terrain, situational awareness, navigation and data sharing. This iOS app is based on the ATAK (Android Tactical Assault Kit) developed by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory.  Note: The application is being developed as a proof that I practice the Swift language, with something that I am interested in, and I have no bad intentions when developing the application.
